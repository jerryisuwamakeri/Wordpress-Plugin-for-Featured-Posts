# Wordpress-Plugin-for-Featured-Posts
A Plugin to Show Wordpress Featured Posts
This Plugin will use Shortcodes to Place Featured accross Various Segments of the Website you are Building.
Let's say, you are using ELementor, WPBakery and other Page Builders or the normal Widgets Tool, where you will simply select Shortcode and you will have a Provision to type or Paste the Shortcode, for example, you can use the [cfp_featured_posts] shortcode in your WordPress content to display the featured posts. Additionally, you can specify the number of featured posts to display by using the count attribute, like [cfp_featured_posts count="3"]
 This plugin allows site administrators to select a specific category of posts to be featured on the homepage through the plugin settings page. The featured posts are displayed using a shortcode with customizable count.
